# Introduction to Python Programming - Computer Programming Sessional 1

Welcome to the repository for the **Introduction to Python Programming** course, titled as **Computer Programming Sessional 1(WRE-202)** . This repository contains various Jupyter Notebook files for each class session, where you will learn and practice fundamental Python concepts and programming techniques.

## Course Overview
This course aims to introduce students to Python programming by covering essential topics such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, file handling, Introduction to python packages and libraries, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Exploratory Data Analyis and Data Visualisation in Python. The course is designed for beginners and includes hands-on practice through class lectures and exercises.

## How to Use the Files

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   To get started, clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
   - Clone:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intro-python-programming.git
     ```
   - Or, download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't, follow these steps:
   - Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

   Alternatively, you can use platforms like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the notebooks directly in your browser.

3. **Run the Notebooks**  
   - Navigate to the folder containing the notebooks and open Jupyter Notebook from your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Alternatively, open each `.ipynb` file directly from Google Colab by uploading them there.

4. **Session Overview**  
   Each notebook corresponds to a different class lecture. The topics covered in these sessions include:
   
   - **Session 1**: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebook
   - **Session 2**: Variables, Data Types
   - **Session 3**: Operators and Conditional Statements
   - **Session 4**: Loop
   - **Session 5**: Data Structures in Python (Set , Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries)
   - **Session 6**: Function in Python
   - **Session 7**: Python Packages and Libraries, Numpy
   - **Session 8**: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python using Pandas
   - **Session 9**: Data Visualisation in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - **Session 10**: Final Project and Review
   
   Each notebook contains examples, explanations, and exercises to help reinforce the concepts. You can interact with the code, modify it, and test your understanding by running the cells.

5. **Exercise and Practice**  
   At the end of each notebook, there are practice exercises that allow you to apply what you've learned. Try to complete these exercises and submit them as part of your course requirements.

6. **Support and Issues**  
   If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to raise an issue in the GitHub Issues tab or contact your instructor.
